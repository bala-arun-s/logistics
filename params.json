{"name":"Logistics","tagline":"","body":"# LOGISTICS APPLICATION\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe term ‘Logistics’ refers to the commercial activity of the transportation of goods i.e., transportation of goods from one place to the other. In the application we try to ease the process of Logistics. Here, we collect the details from the sender to know the destination of the receiver of the product and we also update the information as required by the receiver for their ease, to reduce the misconception of the address to require the package from the sender. This app works with the tie-ups provided by the Logistics service providers, for the transportation where we ensure the accurate precision for the delivery of the packages.\r\n\r\n## UI-side\r\n\r\nIonic framework (v6.9.1) is used in the process of enabling the client-side workflow in the application. It also provides the ability to manage the front-end of the application.\r\nAngular Js (v9.1.8) is used to enable the client-side scripting which is embedded in the ionic framework.\r\n\r\n## Server-side\r\n\r\nNode JS (v12.16.3) software is used in order to perform server-side programming where we use certain modules like Express and so on.\r\n\r\n## Database\r\n\r\nMongo Db (v4.2.7) is a no-SQL database, which is used in order to store the information regarding the users of the application.\r\n\r\n## Screen Navigation Flow\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bala-arun-s/logistics/master/raw/Screen%20Navigation%20Flow%20.png\" alt=\"Screen Navigation Flow\" >\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Pages in this Application\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bala-arun-s/logistics/master/raw/Description%20page.png\" width=\"30%\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Description page\">\r\n\r\n### Description page\r\nInitially the application loads with the ‘Description’ page where it describes the application in brief, where it welcomes the users and it has a welcome button at bottom which navigates to ‘log-in’ page.\r\n<table> <tr></tr> </table>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bala-arun-s/logistics/master/raw/Log-In%20page.png\" width=\"30%\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Log-In page\">\r\n\r\n### Log-In page\r\nThe ‘Login’ page here the user can enter their username and password to get into the application.
