# LOGISTICS APPLICATION
## Description

The term ‘Logistics’ refers to the commercial activity of the transportation of goods i.e., transportation of goods from one place to the other. In the application we try to ease the process of Logistics. Here, we collect the details from the sender to know the destination of the receiver of the product and we also update the information as required by the receiver for their ease, to reduce the misconception of the address to require the package from the sender. This app works with the tie-ups provided by the Logistics service providers, for the transportation where we ensure the accurate precision for the delivery of the packages.

## UI-side

Ionic framework(v6.9.1) is used in the process of enabling the client-side workflow in the application. It also provides the ability to manage the front-end of the application.
Angular Js(v9.1.8) is used to enable the client-side scripting which is embedded in the ionic framework.

## Server-side

Node JS(v12.16.3) software is used in order to perform server-side programming where we use certain modules like Express and so on.

## Database

Mongo Db(v4.2.7) is a no-SQL database, which is used in order to store the information regarding the users of the application.
